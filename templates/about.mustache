<h2>About</h2>

<p>So you found Hacker News and think it's pretty nifty. Only problem is it's very distracting- all that new stuff all the time! You don't want to be tempted to check it every waking moment of the day!</p>

<p>You've tried <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/">HN Daily</a>- it's great that it limits how many stories distract you, but you're still distracted more often than you need.</p>

<p><a href="/">HN Weekly</a> gives you the best of Hacker News once a week, on the day of your choosing. Plow through your side projects and startup stuff six days a week, and save HN for your Friday evening in. Or whenever.</p>

<p>All the fun, now less distracting.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Hasn't this <a href="http://www.hackernewsletter.com/">been done already?</a></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Indeed, I'm not the first person to take a stab at solving this problem, but I think my approach is distinct and worthwhile in its own right.</p>
        
        <p>So how does HN Weekly differ from Hacker Newsletter?<p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Hacker Newsletter is a hand-curated list of links, neatly ordered into categories. Kale does a nice job of finding articles that are quite interesting, but didn't attract the attention of enough people to make it to the week's top-voted list.</p>

                <p>HN Weekly, by contrast, relies on the entire community to decide what the best stories of the week are, rather than any individual's opinion. You can think of the difference as skewing a little further away from "interesting" and a little closer to "important".</p>

                <p>If you're not sure which you'd prefer, subscribe to both!</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Hacker Newsletter gives you more control over how much and how often you recieve your posts. Hacker Newsletter has a fixed amount of content, which may be too much or too little for you. It also comes on a fixed schedule, which may distract you at an inopportune time of week or time of day.</p>

                <p>HN Weekly lets you schedule the day of week and time of day your posts come in, placing you in control of when you're distracted, and how distracted you get.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
            <p>Hacker Newsletter is only available as an email newsletter. HN Weekly also offers an RSS feed, giving you more freedom in how you receive your HN fix. Plus, since each story is in a separate RSS item, you can use a smart RSS reader like <a href="http://newsblur.com">Newsblur</a> to filter articles on keywords, seeing only what you want.</p>

    <dt>I want even fewer distractions! I want filters and stuff!</dt>
    <dd>HN Weekly puts out an RSS feed that you can plug into the <a href="http://newsblur.com">Newsblur</a> RSS reader. Newsblur lets you train it with what you do and don't like to see in feeds, so you never have to see stories with keywords you don't like</dd>

    <dt>Not good enough! I want more!</dt>
    <dd>HN weekly is <a href="https://github.com/spiffytech/hn-weekly">open source</a> and if you know some of JavaScript, it's really easy to host your own copy and apply your own filters to HN Weekly.</dd>
